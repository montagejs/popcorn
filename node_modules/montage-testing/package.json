  "readme": "Montage Testing\n===============================\n\nMontageJS uses some pure unit tests that are straightforward [Jasmine specs][1].\n\n To install the test code, run `npm install` in your project folder. This installs\n the [montage-testing][2] package, which adds some useful utilities for writing\n jasmine tests. You will need the file run-tests.html.\n\n For an example of how we implement unit testing, see the [digit][3] repository:\n\n * [run-tests][4] loads our test environment.\n * `data-module=\"test/all\"` inside the final script tag tells the system to load [test/all.js][5].\n * all.js specifies a list of module ids for the runner to execute.\n\n >Note that in this example, all the tests load a page in an iframe using\n `TestPageLoader.queueTest()`. These are akin to integration tests since they test\n the component in a real environment.\n\n We also test some components by [mocking their dependencies][6].\n\n\n [1]: https://github.com/montagejs/montage/blob/master/test/core/super-spec.js        \"Jasmine specs\"\n [2]: https://github.com/montagejs/montage-testing        \"montage-testing\"\n [3]: https://github.com/montagejs/digit        \"digit\"\n [4]: https://github.com/montagejs/digit/blob/master/run-tests.html        \"run-tests\"\n [5]: https://github.com/montagejs/digit/tree/master/test        \"test/all.js\"\n [6]: https://github.com/montagejs/montage/blob/master/test/base/abstract-button-spec.js        \"mocking their dependencies\"\n\n Last edited: March 12, 2014\n",
